## Your task

Generate a complete Neo4j Marp slide deck about: **$ARGUMENTS**

Follow these steps exactly:

1. **Derive a filename** from the topic in kebab-case (e.g. `graph-rag-intro.md`). Keep it short and descriptive.

2. **Write the deck** to that filename in the project root. The output must be a complete, ready-to-build `.md` file — no explanation, no code fences wrapping the whole file.

3. **Build to PDF**:
   ```
   node build.mjs <filename> --pdf
   ```

4. **Report** the output filename and PDF path to the user.
